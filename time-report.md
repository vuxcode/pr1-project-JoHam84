I had to change a lot of the code in the game.html. Now it's more simple for me to understand and make changeses in the program. 
The changes: 
* Changed the function for looping the buttons. Removed the DO function.
* Added comments so I can more easily follow what is happening in the code.
* Solved the problem with only being able to have one unique button.
*Added the timer and a counter. When the user has finished the game, the player can enter ther initials. The initials and the total time will be aved in a scoreboard
in index.html page.
